# question 1 
'''Imagine you have two mysterious numbers. Your task is to write a program that 
reveals which one of them is the bigger one. How will you solve this puzzle?'''
n1=int(input("enter the number n1:"))
n2=int(input("enter the number n2:"))
if n1>n2:
   print(f"n1 is bigger number:{n1}")
elif n2>n1:
    print(f"n2 is bigger number:{n2}")
else:
    print("both are equal")
# question 2
'''.You have two secret numbers, and you need to figure out how they relate to each other 
using a set of special tools. Your challenge is to write a program that uses these tools—>, 
>=, <, <=, ==, and !=—to uncover all the secrets about how these numbers compare. How 
will you use each tool to solve the puzzle?
